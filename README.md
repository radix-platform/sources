The Tree of Radix and Third Party Sources
=========================================

Simply clone this repository on your own **FTP** server and make your mirror
of third party sources to speed up downloads using your local FTP instead of
downloading from remote Internet resources before building your packages.

Also you can create your own mirrors of frequently used 3pp repositories
to speed up the taking snapshots process [in the same way as we do](http://git.radix.pro/).
