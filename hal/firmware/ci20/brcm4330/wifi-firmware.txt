WiFi firmware
=============

WiFi on the CI20 is provided by a BRCM4330 chip that requires closed source firmware.
These files cannot be shipped as part of the kernel repository and are instead loaded
through user space.

The required files can be found here or copied and renamed from the Debian NAND image,
as is illustrated below:

  ci20:/lib/firmware/iw8103/fw_bcm4330b2.bin -> /lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac4330-sdio.bin
  ci20:/lib/firmware/iw8103/nv_4330b2.txt    -> /lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac4330-sdio.txt

Note: Without these files the wireless driver will fail when loading.

It is a good idea to unload the Broadcom module after copying over the firmware:

  # modprobe -r brcmfmac

Then load the module to enable WiFi:

  # modprobe brcmfmac
