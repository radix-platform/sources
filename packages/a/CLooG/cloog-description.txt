======================================

CLooG is a free software and library to generate code for scanning Z-polyhedra.
That is, it finds a code (e.g. in C, FORTRAN...) that reaches each integral point
of one or more parameterized polyhedra. CLooG has been originally written to solve
the code generation problem for optimizing compilers based on the polytope model.
Nevertheless it is used now in various area e.g. to build control automata for
high-level synthesis or to find the best polynomial approximation of a function.
CLooG may help in any situation where scanning polyhedra matters. While the user
has full control on generated code quality, CLooG is designed to avoid control
overhead and to produce a very effective code.

====================

CLooG 0.18.1: official and recommended isl-based version (updated: October 11th, 2013).

CLooG comes with an embedded version of isl so you should not need to install any polyhedral
library if you don't have one. In any other case please check the documentation page
[http://www.bastoul.net/cloog/documentation.php].

The current version is a major step since 0.14.x, including a much better API. The "old way"
to interface with CLooG should still work, however we plan to remove it for the next major
version, so please update... The new version is still under evaluation, and there is no
guarantee that the upward compatibility will be respected. A lot of reports are needed to
freeze the library API and the input file shape. So you are very welcome and encouraged to
send reports on bugs, wishes, critics, comments, suggestions or successful experiences to
the according mailing list, see the documentation page.

Requirement
===========

    GMP 5.0.2 (or any later version).

  The embedded version of isl used by CLooG needs the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library.
  It should be installed in your system before trying to install CLooG. At the moment, isl offers
  only multiple precision (no 32 bits nor 64 bits: if you need such a version you should consider
  either CLooG-polylib or CLooG-parma, please check the documentation for those versions).
  Once GMP is downloaded and unpacked (e.g., using the "tar -jxvf gmp-4.3.2.tar.bz2" command),
  you can compile it by typing the following commands on GMP's root directory:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    And as root: make install

  If you install GMP this way, it should be OK. If you are doing another way and you are experiencing
  problems, please have a look at the documentation on installation. If nothing works for you, ask us
  using the according mailing list (see documentation page).

Development Version
===================

    http://repo.or.cz/w/cloog.git (Official repository of CLooG). 

  To benefit from the latest improvements and bug fixes you can try the development version of
  CLooG: A major improvement is the support of multiple backends, not only PolyLib.
  CLooG is now supporting PPL and the isl (Integer Set Library) is the default backend.
  Because isl does not rely on rationals, CLooG is able to generate significantly better codes,
  with low control overhead. To compile the development version of CLooG with the isl backend:

    git clone git://repo.or.cz/cloog.git
    cd cloog
    ./get_submodules.sh
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --with-gmp-prefix=/path/to/gmp/installation
    make
    And as root: make install
