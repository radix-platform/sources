There are presently two versions of the kernel

 - the ci20-v3.0.8 kernel branch as shipped by default
   in the Debian NAND image derived directly from
   the Ingenic kernel source code releases.
 - the latest kernel branch (ci20-v3.18 as of 02-03-2014)
   tracking mainline which is a nearly complete work in
   progress of upstreamable quality code to be soon pushed
   towards kernel.org. See details about this branch here
