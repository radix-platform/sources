Open Source Mali Utgard GPU Linux Kernel Drivers:
================================================

Source code for Mali GPUs Kernel Device Drivers, UMP Device Drivers and DRM Device Drivers under GPLv2 licence

The Linux and Android version of the Mali GPUs DDKs include three components which run within the kernel.
The most important of these, known as the Device Driver, provides the low-level access to the Mali-400 and
Mali-450 GPU. An important, secondary component is the Unified Memory Provider (UMP) which can be used
in a variety of ways to facilitate zero-copy operations within the driver stack. An additional component,
the Mali Direct Rendering Manager (DRM), is provided to integrate the Mali GPU DDKs into the X11 environment
and for enabling the Direct Rendering Interface (DRI2).

Some of these components are being made available under the GPLv2 licence. This page provides access
to the source packages from which loadable kernel modules can be built.

Note that these components are not a complete driver stack. To build a functional OpenGL ES or OpenVG
driver you need access to the full source code of the Mali GPU DDK, which is provided under the standard
ARM commercial licence to all Mali GPU customers. For a complete integration of the Mali GPU DDK with
the X11 environment refer to the Integration Guide supplied with the Mali GPU DDK.

The open source drivers provided on this page are designed to run with a version-compatible release
of the Mali GPU DDK. In functional and performance terms they are identical to the implementations
provided under the commercial licence. By also releasing them under the GPLv2 licence we hope to make
it easier to include Mali GPU drivers in any Linux or Android platform.

Happy Hacking!

FEATURES AND BENEFITS

The Mali GPU kernel device driver handles:

 - Access to the Mali GPU hardware
 - Interrupt handling
 - Low level memory management

The UMP kernel device driver handles:

 - Access to allocated UMP memory through a secure ID. This enables memory to be shared across
   different applications, drivers and hardware components to facilitate zero-copy operations
 - The physical address information required to set up an MMU or MPU table
 - A method to map UMP memory into CPU address space, to enable reading and writing
